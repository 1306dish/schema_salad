SALAD is Semantic Annotations for Linked Avro Data.

Salad is a schema language that describes structured data based on Apache Avro
with additional annotations to provide richer data modeling and markup to
enable generating a JSON-LD context directly from the underlying schema.

Please note that Salad is still under development and not quite ready for general use.
